      <p>Why is a good password so important?</p>
      <p>
        Many people today don't think they need to create a strong password. They tell themselves they're 
        not important enough to be hacked. But that mindset makes them an easy target for hackers who are 
        looking for weak security. It’s much easier for a hacker to break into an account with a simple password 
        than to go after someone with top level protection, so anyone can be a target. That’s why you should make 
        sure your passwords are strong and avoid using the same one across all your accounts. If a hacker breaches 
        one site, they could access everything, including your email, banking, and social media. It’s always a 
        good idea to create strong, secure passwords. A strong password should include a mix of random words, numbers, 
        and special characters (e.g., RedHungrySteve27!). Taking the time to build strong passwords can help protect 
        your personal information and prevent it from being stolen.
